# Production Permission-First Sync Log — 2026-09-05

## Identity lock

- Repository: `Premieros/johna-s`
- Source baseline: `main@79d34660ea4770b2461bef69286a664d9c647805`
- Production Supabase: `azzdesuowpdcoflmyezn`
- No other repository or database is authorized for this batch.

## Verified source baseline

`main@79d34660ea4770b2461bef69286a664d9c647805` passed Verify #736 and Deploy #526 before Production synchronization started.

## Production migration gap

Production migration history ended at source migration `20260905103458_restore_permission_first_user_branch_access` before this batch. The verified source contained seven later migrations.

Applied successfully before drift was exposed:

1. `20260905110500_permission_first_root_drift_cleanup.sql`
2. `20260905110550_permission_first_endpoint_normalization.sql`
3. `20260905110575_permission_first_purchase_kitchen_normalization.sql`

The next migration, `20260905110600_permission_first_runtime_reconcile.sql`, correctly failed closed on Production instead of bypassing its audit.

Exact Production function drift detected:

- `create_organization_branch(uuid,text,text,text,text)`
- `delete_branch_cascade(uuid)`
- `get_user_branch_access(uuid)`
- `open_shift(uuid,numeric,text)`
- `user_may_access_branch(uuid)`

The Production copies still contained fixed-role or organization-membership authorization (`owner`, `admin`, `cashier`) that is absent from the clean Fresh DB state.

## Function reconciliation

Added preflight migration:

- `20260905110590_production_permission_first_drift_reconcile.sql`

It deliberately sorts after `10575` and before the existing fail-closed `10600` migration. It does not weaken the `10600` audit.

Authorization rules in the repair:

- `user_may_access_branch`: Super Admin bypass + explicit `user_branch_access` + active primary branch only.
- `get_user_branch_access`: explicit/primary grants only; cross-user inspection requires explicit user-management capability.
- branch creation/deletion: `branches.manage` plus branch/org scope; Super Admin remains the only implicit bypass.
- successful branch creation records explicit `user_branch_access` for the authorized creator; no owner/admin role inheritance is restored.
- shift opening: `shifts.open` plus canonical branch access; no `cashier` role-name gate.
- only one open shift is allowed per user globally; successful `open_shift` returns both `shift_id` and `branch_id`.
- repaired SECURITY DEFINER functions use `search_path = public, pg_temp` and explicit EXECUTE grants.

Regression coverage added:

- `tests/integration/production_permission_first_drift.test.ts`

## Verify #737 — first preflight run

Run `33987695872` / Verify #737 passed frontend + Fresh DB/schema, then Integration/Security/RLS failed with seven assertions and Browser Smoke was skipped. Exact root causes were:

1. branch creation denial contract changed from `FORBIDDEN`.
2. authorized branch creation did not create an explicit branch-access grant for the creator.
3. `open_shift` omitted `branch_id` and allowed simultaneous open shifts per branch instead of one per user.

No tests/RLS were weakened. The preflight was corrected accordingly.

## Verify #739 / PR #22

Run `33988027648` / Verify #739 passed all required gates:

- frontend verify ✅
- Fresh DB migrations/schema ✅
- Integration/Security/RLS ✅
- Browser Smoke ✅

PR #22 was merged as `main@0cde328020f6ea4532179cf41f959e97723ccc14`.

The verified `10590` preflight was then applied successfully to Production.

## Production RLS drift found by 10600

Retrying the existing `20260905110600_permission_first_runtime_reconcile.sql` again failed closed, now only on six Production RLS policies:

- `products:auth_insert_products`
- `products:auth_update_products`
- `products:auth_delete_products`
- `inventory:auth_insert_inventory`
- `inventory:auth_update_inventory`
- `inventory:auth_delete_inventory`

Read-only inspection confirmed the Production policies still referenced retired coarse permissions:

- `products.manage`
- `inventory.manage`

Added a second preflight migration:

- `20260905110595_production_rls_permission_first_drift_reconcile.sql`

It keeps RLS enabled and maps the six policies to canonical granular capabilities:

- product INSERT → `products.create`
- product UPDATE → `products.edit`
- product DELETE → `products.delete`
- inventory INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE → `inventory.adjust`
- all non-Super-Admin operations remain scoped by `user_may_access_branch(branch_id)`.

This second preflight must pass Fresh DB + Integration/Security/RLS + Browser Smoke before Production application. The original `10600` fail-closed audit remains unchanged and must pass afterward.

## Production tail synchronization — current main

Production synchronization continued only after the Permission-First reconciliation path had reached `permission_first_runtime_reconcile` successfully.

Migration source for this tail batch was pinned to:

- `main@8168b53c42218897cb4c2a90651f6b7e432b8ce1`
- Production project: `azzdesuowpdcoflmyezn`

The following repository-tracked migrations were applied successfully, in order, with no ad-hoc Production DDL:

1. `20260905110610_permission_first_regression_closure.sql` → Production migration `20260905204921 permission_first_regression_closure` ✅
2. `20260905110625_permission_first_regression_closure.sql` → Production migration `20260905204954 permission_first_regression_closure` ✅
3. `20260905214500_security_definer_handover_hardening.sql` → Production migration `20260905205014 security_definer_handover_hardening` ✅

The two regression-closure migrations keep role management capability-first and branch-scoped, align stock-count approval with canonical branch access, and preserve Super Admin as the only implicit bypass. The `10625` closure also replaces the historical role-name shift behavior with capability-based `pos.payment.take` / `shifts.manage` logic.

The P0-B handover migration changed `_production_schema_contract_kitchen_v1()` to `SECURITY INVOKER`, restricted Super Admin cross-user/statistics RPCs with explicit Super Admin predicates and grants, and made future `public` functions fail closed by default for `PUBLIC`, `anon`, and `authenticated` EXECUTE unless a later migration explicitly opts in.

## Security Advisor after tail sync

A fresh Security Advisor run after all three migrations confirms that `_production_schema_contract_kitchen_v1()` no longer appears as an anonymous SECURITY DEFINER warning.

Remaining security-advisor work is intentionally not bulk-mutated:

- anonymous SECURITY DEFINER exposure remains for `get_login_email(text)` and `record_login_failure(text)`;
- many authenticated API RPCs remain SECURITY DEFINER and must be classified individually as intended API, internal helper, or privileged/admin-only before changing EXECUTE or invoker semantics;
- Supabase Auth Leaked Password Protection remains disabled.

Relevant Supabase remediation references:

- anon SECURITY DEFINER: https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/database-linter?lint=0028_anon_security_definer_function_executable
- authenticated SECURITY DEFINER: https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/database-linter?lint=0029_authenticated_security_definer_function_executable
- leaked-password protection: https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/password-security#password-strength-and-leaked-password-protection

No blanket revokes or SECURITY INVOKER conversions were applied because several listed RPCs are intentional authenticated application endpoints and require contract-aware review first.

## Post-sync verification — 2026-09-06 00:08 Africa/Cairo

A follow-up reconciliation was performed after `main` advanced to `2ba220ba35223c825feb703bd1dd2b1ba57808f7`.

- Repository checked: `Premieros/johna-s` only.
- Production checked: `azzdesuowpdcoflmyezn` only.
- Production migration history already contained the complete Permission-First tail through `20260905205014 security_definer_handover_hardening`.
- No missing current-main tail migration was identified in this verification pass.
- No migration was re-applied and no ad-hoc Production DDL was executed.
- This was intentionally a no-op database pass to avoid duplicate mutation while another development session may be updating the repository concurrently.

Result: Production remained synchronized with the already-recorded Permission-First tail; the next open work remains the contract-aware SECURITY DEFINER audit and remaining security-advisor items rather than migration replay.

## Safety rule

No Production audit was bypassed and no RLS/test was weakened. All Production changes are applied only to `azzdesuowpdcoflmyezn`, and every drift repair is promoted through CI before Production.
